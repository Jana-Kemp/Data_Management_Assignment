# Data_Management_Assignment
This repository was created for an assignment for the Reproducible research and data management module in my Biological Sciences BSc(Honours) course at the University of Cape Town (UCT).

Data used in this assignment originate from a practical in BIO3018F, a course completed in 2024. Data collection was guided by Dr Dawood Hattas on the 23rd of January 2024 in De Hoop Nature Reserve (34°26’S, 20°30’E). No lisence was placed on the data.
Three localities were used, each of a different vegetation type: Fynbos, Renosterveld, and Grassland. It was noted that renosterveld species had started to invade the grassland site. Herbivory presence was measured using an indirect census of dung counts along a transect. Five 50m transects that were 10m apart were taken at each locality. Each transect was made up of five 2m^2 plots, 3m apart. Any dung piles in the plots were counted and identified using Gutteridge and Louis (2013). Dung pellets had to be a minimum of 50cm apart to be classified as 2 piles, and very old dung was not counted. The type and abundance of dung piles were recorded in Excel and later converted to a csv file.

The statistical analyses from the BIO3018F practical were not used in the code in this repository. Instead a simple boxplot was created for demonstration.
